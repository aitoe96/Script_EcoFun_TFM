# Script_EcoFun_TFM
This script is the one used for the analysis of the data used in the final master's thesis of Aitor Martínez Pérez in the MADOBIS course 2021/22, 
entitled "Genome-wide patterns of gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes in a natural setting".

This script consists of several parts and proprietary functions for the analysis of RNA-Seq data of Arabidopsis thaliana species, which are:

-Exploratory data analysis and data normalization.
-Differential gene expression analysis and gene ontology enrichment.
-Venn diagrams and selection of common and specific genes.
-Clustering of expression data. 

The code is commented and explained step by step in Spanish and the beginning and the end of the own functions created to automate the analysis are indicated. 

The packages necessary for the execution of the analysis are specified at the beginning of the code, 
as well as when they need to be loaded for the first time in the body of the code before its use. 

If any clarification is needed, please send an email to "aitoe96lg@gmail.com" and put in the subject "EcoFun code question".

The author of this code is Aitor MP, student from the Master in Omic Data Analysis and Systems Biology at 
International University of Andalusia and University of Seville.
